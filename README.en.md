Discord bot currently under development.

This project is a base for a Discord bot written in JavaScript with a modular architecture (commands, events, etc.).  
It is closely linked to the [NomadeBot_TTV](https://github.com/TheArabicMonster/NomadeBot_TTV) repository and aims to let users interact on Discord with items looted on Twitch, inspired by the inventory system of **Dank Memer**.

> ⚠️ This project is a **work in progress**: many features are still being tested, developed, or planned.
